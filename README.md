# D3 Investigation

Just playing with D3.

# Running locally

* Have a recent copy of node, npm (for installing yarn), and yarn running. I'm running:
  * yarn 1.22.22
  * node 21.7.1
  * npm 10.5.0
* `package.json` has scripts set up 
* `$ yarn clean` to delete old builds
* `$ yarn compile` to compile the ts to js
* `$ yarn build` to copy everything to the dist directory
* `$ yarn start` starts the http server
* Navigate to http://localhost

## In VSCode

Once you've done the initial build, you can make updates & debug in VSCode by starting the debugger with `F5`.
